# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
Predicting how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan (Kaggle Challenge).

# Getting Started
Insufficient or non-existent credit records make it difficult for many people to get loans. Unfortunately, untrustworthy lenders frequently take advantage of this group.

By delivering a pleasurable and secure borrowing experience, Home Credit aims to increase financial inclusion for the unbanked. Home Credit uses a range of alternative data, such as telecom and transactional information, to anticipate their clients' repayment capacities in order to ensure that this underserved demographic has a favorable lending experience.

While Home Credit is presently making these predictions using a variety of statistical and machine learning approaches, they are pushing Kagglers to help them realise the full potential of their data. As a result, customers who are competent of repayment will not be turned down, and loans will be issued with a principal, maturity, and repayment schedule that will enable their clients to succeed.

The goal of this competition is to forecast whether or not a borrower will be able to repay a loan using prior loan application data. This is an example of a typical supervised classification task:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.

Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)
